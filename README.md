# talkytime
Speak the current time.

Use this to timestamp audio recordings to USB sticks on your digital pianos
that don't maintain wallclock time.

Note that iPad/iPhone doesn't send speech synthesis to digital pianos over
bluetooth, despite configuring the bluetooth setting as headphones instead of
speakers.  You'll have to wire it up physically instead over an
USB-C-to-analog-audio or Lightning adapter instead.
